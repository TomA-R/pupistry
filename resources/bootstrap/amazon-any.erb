# This bootstrap is specifcially for Amazon's Linux AMIs, if you are using
# other distributions like Ubuntu or CentOS on AWS, use those bootstrap

# Amazon Linux is based on RHEL, but has a lot more variations that other
# clones like CentOS, such as shipping with multiple versions of Puppet
# and Ruby - which is useful, but can also make life.... interesting.
