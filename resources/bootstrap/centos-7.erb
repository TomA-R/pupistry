# Bootstrap for CentOS 7 and maybe other EL-derived platforms.

# Note: Amusingly doesn't actually work on RHEL itself, since ruby-devel
#       does not seem to exist on it :-/ If you actually care about RHEL
#       itself, I'll happily accept a pull request that does whatever is
#       needed to fix ruby-devel on RHEL.
