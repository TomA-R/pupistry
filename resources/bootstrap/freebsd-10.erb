#!/bin/tcsh -x
# This bootstrap is for FreeBSD 10.x which has most of the same principals of
# Linux, but we have had to make some variations to account for tcsh weirdness
# vs the general behavior we expect from bash on Linux distributions

# Known Issues:
# * tcsh makes capturing all the output to syslog difficult
# * We can't rely on Bash, since it's not available in FreeBSD by default.
# * Digital Ocean has no support for FreeBSD user data yet
# * AWS FreeBSD images take a long time to launch - 10mins+
# * Override some config to use /usr/local for everything
#
