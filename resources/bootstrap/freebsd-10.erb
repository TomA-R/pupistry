#!/bin/tcsh -x
# This bootstrap is for FreeBSD 10.x which has most of the same principals of
# Linux, but we have had to make some variations to account for tcsh weirdness
# vs the general behavior we expect from bash on Linux distributions

# Known Issues:
# * AWS and Digital Ocean issues:
#   http://www.jethrocarr.com/2015/04/19/freebsd-in-the-cloud/
# * We use Puppet 4 from Ports to avoid limitations in older Puppet 3 release:
#   https://www.jethrocarr.com/2015/04/22/puppet-3-and-4-on-freebsd/
# * tcsh makes capturing all the output to syslog difficult, so we don't do it.
# * We can't rely on Bash, since it's not available in FreeBSD by default.
